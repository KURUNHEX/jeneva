            <h2 id="h1">MUSICIANS OF ALL TIME, IN ANY GENRE: THE COMPLETE LIST</h2>
            Our team of writers listened to thousands and thousands of hours of music for this list, digging deep into the annals of history 
            and exploring the sounds of the entire globe. We painstakingly researched the shit out of practically all music ever made, modern 
            and classical, popular and experimental, chart-topping and obscure. You may not agree with every artist on this list, but one thing 
            is for certain: You're going to respect the hell out of it. <b>-Ben Westhoff</b><br>

            <h2 id="h2">Antonio Vivaldi</h2>
            <b> was an Italian composer, virtuoso violinist and impresario of Baroque music.[4] Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and George 
                Frideric Handel, Vivaldi ranks amongst the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread 
                across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique 
                and programmatic music.[5] He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom.</b>
                <p>Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral 
                    works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons. Many of his 
                    compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet√†, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi 
                    began studying for the priesthood at the age of 15 and was ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public 
                    Masses due to a health problem.[6] Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and 
                    Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon 
                    after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.</p>
